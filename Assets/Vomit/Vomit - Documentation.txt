A vomit throwing up particle spray effect!

Load "Vomit.unity" for an example scene (with two particle effects synced to audio), or simply drag the particle effect from the Prefabs folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window. Note that there is a both a single spray and a looping effect.

Have fun!
